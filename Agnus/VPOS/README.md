## Objective

Visualize the value of the position registers 

#### vpos1

During vBlank, VPOSR is read and split into four 4-bit chunks. After that, the chunks are written into color registers 0 to 3 to make the bit-pattern visible. The color values exhibit the identification bits of Agnus and Denise that are part of this register.
