## Objective

This test suite verfies properties of the DMACON register

#### bplen1 and bplen2

These tests toggle the BPLEN bit at various DMA cycle positions.
Make sure to select "OCS Chipset" in SAE to reproduce the reference image. The ECS chipset behaves differently, i.e., when switching DMA on in the middle of the rasterline.
