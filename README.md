## Overview

This repo contains various Amiga example programs that have been developed for testing the vAmiga emulator. Each test consists of a disk image in ADF format and reference images taken from other emulators. Some tests come with an additional screenshot taken from a real A500. 

Most tests are modifications of the Amiga example programs written by Alpine9000.

Directory cputester contains various ADFs that have been created with the cputester tool written by Toni Wilen. All disks have been set up to auto-boot and test a single instruction each.
