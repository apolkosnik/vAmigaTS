## Objective

This test suite verfies particular aspects of the JUMP command (by writing into strobe registers COPJMPx).

#### jump1

At a certain position, Copper list 1 jumps to Copper list 2 which repeats itself. To visualize timing, the background color is alternated continously in the second Copper list.
