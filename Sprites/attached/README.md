## Objective

Verify basic properties of the attachment bit

#### attached1 (DEPRECATED)

Draws two columns of attached sprites (sprites with the AT bit set).

#### attached2 to attached4

Draws attached sprites with both matching and unmatching horizontal coordinates.

#### attached5

Draws overlapping sprites with different AT bit combinations.

#### attached6

Same as attached5 with the AT bit combinations reversed. The AT bint combinations are changed manually by writing into the SPRxCTL registers with the Copper.
