## Objective

The tests in this test suite modify register BPLCON1 (biplane shift values) in various ways.

#### shift1

Modified BPLCON1 at each red line. The display window (DIW) is opend up as much as possible. 

#### shift1d, shift1h, shift1dh

Same as shift1 in dual-playfield mode, hires mode, or both. 

#### shift2

Same as shift1 and shift1h with simpler values. Even and odd bitplanes are always equal.
